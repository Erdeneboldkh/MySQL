World Layoffs Data Cleaning Project
This project focuses on cleaning and organizing data about layoffs worldwide using MySQL.

What I Did
1. Created a database schema called world_layoffs to store the data.
2. Removed duplicate entries to keep the data accurate.
3. Standardized data formats and naming to ensure consistency.
4. Fixed missing or blank values.
5. Deleted unnecessary columns and rows to keep the data relevant and clean.

Tools Used
